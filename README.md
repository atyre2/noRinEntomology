## Outline
1. Why worry?

2. The big picture (from Christopher Gandrud's book on RR with R and RStudio) 
  * Document everything
  * Everything is a (text) file

  * Explicitly tie files together
  * Plan the organization, storage and sharing of your files
2. Organizing your workflow
  * Directory structure
  * File naming conventions -- e.g. CamelBack style
  * RStudio projects
3. Concept of a Source Document as the target of all work
  * Code plus words in a single document
  * Producing the output
  * A manuscript template
4. Version Control & Collaboration
  * Ghetto control: put the date in the filename
  * Ensuring you have the same data
  * Ensuring you have the same Software! 
  * Dropbox, GitHub, etc
5. Wrapping up
  * citing reproducible research
  * Licensing
