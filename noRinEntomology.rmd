## Outline for the webinar
1. Why worry?
2. The big picture (from Christopher Gandrud's book on RR with R and RStudio) 
2. Organizing your workflow
3. Concept of a Source Document as the target of all work
4. Version Control & Collaboration
5. Wrapping up

## Why Worry? {.build}
- Personal Reasons -- Liz and the revisions
- Credibility
  * Stephen Heard's blogpost [Reproducibility, your methods, and 400 years of Angst](http://bit.ly/1wVSkmk) 
  * The 1^st^ leg of the science-policy interface (Cash et al 2003)
  
## The big picture (Gandrud, 2015)
- Plan the organization, storage and sharing of your files
- Document everything
- Everything is a (text) file
- All files should be human readable
- Explicitly tie files together

# Organizing your workflow

## Bad (no?) Directory Structure

## Better Directory Structure

## Put everything in one directory
- All the code, data, outputs etc. 
- Make this directory an RStudio Project
- This will always be the "working directory"

## Use relative paths
- Breaks on another computer, OS, user
```
mydataframe <- read.table(
"C:\\users\\Drew\\Box Sync\\Teaching\\noRinEntomology\\data\\e418.tab")
```
- Works with all OS, for any computer if directory is copied completely. Easier to read. 

```
mydataframe <- read.table("data/e418.tab")
```

## NoSpaces
- spaces in filenames and directories cause problems for automation
- use CamelBack style filenames for readibility

## One useful structure
- all documents in root directory produce "outputs" (presentations, manuscripts)
- subdirectories for data, code, images, and "automatic outputs"
